Llama is an accessible, open large language model (LLM) designed for developers, researchers, and businesses to build, experiment, and responsibly scale their generative AI ideas. Part of a foundational system, it serves as a bedrock for innovation in the global community. A few key aspects:
1. **Open access**: Easy accessibility to cutting-edge large language models, fostering collaboration and advancements among developers, researchers, and organizations
2. **Broad ecosystem**: Llama models have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, there are thousands of community projects built on Llama and platform support is broad from cloud providers to startups - the world is building with Llama!
3. **Trust & safety**: Llama models are part of a comprehensive approach to trust and safety, releasing models and tools that are designed to enable community collaboration and encourage the standardization of the development and usage of trust and safety tools for generative AI

Our mission is to empower individuals and industry through this opportunity while fostering an environment of discovery and ethical AI advancements. The model weights are licensed for researchers and commercial entities, upholding the principles of openness.

## Download

To download the model weights and tokenizer:

1. Visit the [Meta Llama website](https://llama.meta.com/llama-downloads/).
2. Read and accept the license.
3. Once your request is approved you will receive a signed URL via email.
4. Install the [Llama CLI](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-stack): `pip install llama-toolchain`
5. Run `llama model list` to determine the model ID you wish to download
6. Run: `llama download --source meta --model-id CHOSEN_MODEL_ID`
7. Pass the URL provided when prompted to start the download.

Remember that the links expire after 24 hours and a certain amount of downloads. You can always re-request a link if you start seeing errors such as `403: Forbidden`.

### Download via HuggingFace

We also provide downloads on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) in both transformers and native `llama3` formats. To gain access:

1. Visit one of the repos (ex. [meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)).
2. Read and accept the license.
3. Once your request is approved, you'll be granted access to all Llama 3.1 models as well as previous versions. Note that approvals may take up to one hour.

You can then download the models:

- Via `llama download --source huggingface --hf-token YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` ([create/view access tokens here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))
- Via the HuggingFace CLI (`pip install huggingface-hub`):
- In the web browser by clicking on the "Files and versions" tab

```bash
huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --include "original/*" --local-dir meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
```

The original native weights are in the `original/` subfolder (except for `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B`).


## Using with transformers

- To use with transformers, the following [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines) snippet will download and cache the weights:

  ```python
  import transformers
  import torch

  model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"

  pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device="cuda",
  )
  ```

## Installations

You can install this repository as a [package](https://pypi.org/project/llama-models/) by just doing `pip install llama-models`

## Responsible Use

Llama models are a new technology that carries potential risks with use. Testing conducted to date has not — and could not — cover all scenarios.
To help developers address these risks, we have created the [Responsible Use Guide](https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/responsible-use-guide/).

## Issues

Please report any software “bug” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:
- Reporting issues with the model: [github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/issues](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/issues)
- Reporting risky content generated by the model: [developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback](https://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback)
- Reporting bugs and security concerns: [facebook.com/whitehat/info](https://facebook.com/whitehat/info)
